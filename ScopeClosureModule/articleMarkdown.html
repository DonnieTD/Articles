    <strong>
        Lexical scoping:
    </strong>
    Lexical scope is a scope that is defined at compile time.

    In JavaScript a new scope is created only when you create a new function.

    Here is an example showing the implications of this:
    <pre>
       console.log(a) // a == undefined
       function parentScope(){
          var a = 0;
          function firstScope(){
              console.log(a) // a == 0 
              a = 1;
              console.log(a) // a == 1
          }
          function secondScope(){
              console.log(a) // a == 0 
          }
       }
       console.log(a) // a == undefined
    </pre>

    <strong>
        Closures:
    </strong>
    A closure is the combination of a function enclosed with references to its
    surrounding lexical scope.

    Or in other words it's a function with a special connection to the data
    used by that function.

    <strong>
        !! Even when that data would conventionally be garbage collected!!
    </strong>

    <pre>
      function lexicalEnv() {
         var data = 'Mozilla';
             function functionWithReferenceToData() {
                alert(data );
             }
         return functionWithReferenceToData;
      }
      var Closure = lexicalEnv();
      Closure(); // Alerts 'Mozilla' which demonstrates access to the data variable 
                 // in the lexicalEnv function. 
    </pre>

    <strong>
        IIFE:
    </strong>

    An IIFE is a a function expression that is immediately invoked inside of
    parenthesis , make the whole thing a single expression.

    This effectively creates an isolated new scope that cannot affect the rest of
    the program.

    <pre>
       (function () {
          var untouchAble = true;
       })();
       untouchAble // "Uncaught ReferenceError: untouchAble is not defined"
   </pre>

    <strong>Modules:</strong>

    A module is a design pattern that builds on closure to provide encapsulation.

    Here is the Wikipedia definition of encapsulation:

    In object-oriented programming, encapsulation refers to the bundling of data
    with the methods that operate on that data, or the restricting of direct access
    to some of an object's components.

    The module pattern does this by creating its own scope using IIFE's and then
    returns a object method that closes over the modules' separate scope.

    <pre>

  var myModule = (function() {
    var _publicVar = 'can touch this';
    var _privateMethod = 'can't touch this';
  
    publicFunc: function() {
        console.log('Worked One');
    }
  
    privateFunc: function() {
        console.log('!');
    }
  
    return {
     _publicVar,
      publicFunc
    };
  
  }());
  
  var myModuleTwo = (function() {
    var _publicVar = 'can touch this';
    var _privateMethod = 'can't touch this';
  
    publicFunc: function() {
        console.log('Worked Two');
    }
  
    privateFunc: function() {
        console.log('!');
    }
  
    return {
     _publicVar,
      publicFunc
    };
  
  }());
       
  myModule.publicFunc(); // Worked One
  myModuleTwo .publicFunc(); // Worked Two
  
  </pre>

    <strong>Keep in mindthat the scope in myModule is separate from the scope in myModuleTwo.</strong>
